//! External PII sanitizer contract and configuration (#848).
//!
//! The custom guardrail webhook (ROL-257) returns a *decision* — allow, block,
//! transform. A PII sanitizer has a different job: it returns **transformed
//! content**, and optionally undoes the transform on the way back. That is a
//! distinct contract, which is why it is a distinct module rather than another
//! `action` on [`crate::guardrail_webhook::WebhookDecision`].
//!
//! # Where the plaintext lives
//!
//! Nowhere in rolter. The sanitizer service replaces each detected entity with
//! a deterministic placeholder and keeps the placeholder→plaintext mapping on
//! its own side, handing back an **opaque restoration token**. To restore, the
//! gateway posts that token and the placeholder-bearing text back to the
//! service.
//!
//! This is the whole privacy argument. The gateway never holds a mapping it
//! could leak, so "never persist plaintext mappings in logs, metrics or traces"
//! is true by construction rather than by discipline: there is no plaintext
//! mapping in the process to persist. Findings carry entity types, counts and
//! placeholders — never matched values.
//!
//! # Restoration is a policy, not a default
//!
//! Restoring PII into a response undoes the protection, so it is off unless an
//! operator asks for it, and a token is bound to the tenant and route that
//! produced it — see [`RestorationPolicy`] and [`TokenScope`].
//!
//! This module owns the config model, validation and the wire contract. The
//! async HTTP client and request-path wiring live in the gateway.
