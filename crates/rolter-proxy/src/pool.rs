//! Connection-pool observability for the upstream clients (#834).
//!
//! Pool exhaustion presents as latency with perfectly healthy providers — the
//! one failure mode the existing metrics cannot explain, because every upstream
//! reports fast and the request is still slow. The time is spent waiting for,
//! or rebuilding, a connection.
//!
//! ## Why this is instrumented rather than read
//!
//! `reqwest` and `hyper` expose no pool introspection whatsoever: there is no
//! accessor for idle count, active count, or waiters. What they *do* expose,
//! since reqwest 0.12.9, is [`ClientBuilder::connector_layer`], a tower layer
//! wrapping the connector. Every call to that layer is hyper deciding it has no
//! reusable connection and building a new one, which is exactly the event worth
//! counting.
//!
//! So this measures connection *establishment*, not pool occupancy:
//!
//! - a healthy pool serves a high request rate with a near-flat connection
//!   count, because connections are reused
//! - a pool that is churning — idle timeout too low, `pool_max_idle_per_host`
//!   too small for the concurrency, or a provider hanging up between requests —
//!   shows a connection rate that tracks the request rate
//!
//! That ratio, `rate(connections_total) / rate(requests_total)`, is the signal.
//! At 0 the pool is doing its job; approaching 1 every request is paying a fresh
//! TCP and TLS handshake, and on a cross-region provider that is most of the
//! latency.
//!
//! Idle-vs-active counts remain genuinely unavailable. Getting them would mean
//! wrapping the connection object itself to observe its drop, and the connector
//! layer's response type is `reqwest`'s opaque `Conn` — it cannot be wrapped
//! from outside the crate. Counting establishment is what the API permits, and
//! it answers the question the issue actually posed.
//!
