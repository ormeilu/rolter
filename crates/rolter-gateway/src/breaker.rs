//! Per-target circuit breaker (closed / open / half-open). Complements the
//! short-lived [`crate::cooldowns`] park: a cooldown shrugs off a single wobble,
//! the breaker sheds sustained load off a target that is down hard. State lives
//! outside the routing snapshot (it must survive config hot-reloads) and is keyed
//! by `(public model, target index)`.
//!
//! State machine per target:
//! - **Closed**: traffic flows; consecutive transient failures are counted. When
//!   the count reaches `failure_threshold` the target trips **open**.
//! - **Open**: traffic is skipped until `open_secs` elapse, then the next probe is
//!   admitted, moving the target to **half-open**.
//! - **Half-open**: a single probe is allowed through; a success closes the
//!   breaker (reset), a failure re-opens it for another `open_secs` window.
//!
//! A derived `Default` registry is permanently inert (no backing store) and
//! admits every target. A registry built with [`Breaker::new`] can be enabled,
//! disabled and re-tuned live by [`Breaker::reconfigure`] on a config hot-reload;
//! while disabled it admits every target and records nothing, but keeps its
//! per-target state so re-enabling resumes where it left off.
