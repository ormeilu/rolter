//! Request correlation: an end-to-end `x-request-id` and inbound distributed-
//! trace continuation (ROL-60).
//!
//! [`ensure_request_id`] is a middleware that guarantees every request carries an
//! `x-request-id` — reusing the caller's when present, else minting a UUID — and
//! echoes it on the response so a client can correlate its call with the gateway
//! logs. [`inbound_trace_id`] pulls the trace id out of a W3C `traceparent` or a
//! B3 header so the request log adopts the caller's trace instead of starting a
//! disconnected one; the id is stored on each [`RequestLog`](crate::logging::RequestLog)
//! and surfaces in ClickHouse for cross-service correlation.
//!
//! [`GatewayMakeSpan`] takes that further (#805): it builds the request span and
//! makes the inbound context its real OpenTelemetry *parent*, and [`outbound_headers`]
//! injects the gateway's own span into the upstream call rather than copying the
//! caller's header verbatim. Together those are what put a dashboard click, the
//! gateway, and the provider request in one correctly-parented trace. All of it
//! is inert unless an OTLP endpoint is configured.
