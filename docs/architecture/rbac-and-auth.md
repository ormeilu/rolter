# RBAC & authentication

Two distinct auth surfaces:

## 1. Gateway (data plane) — virtual keys

Clients call `/v1/*` with a **virtual key** (`Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key`). The gateway:

- looks the key up in the current snapshot
- checks the key's model allow-list (empty = all)
- (roadmap) enforces budgets and RPM/TPM limits for the key's scope chain

Keys are stored as hashes; the presented key is compared in constant time (`rolter_auth::verify_key`).

### Empty key sets

An empty effective key set does **not** mean "auth disabled" on a managed
deployment. A gateway started with `--snapshot-url` (its config comes from the
control plane) **fails closed**: with no virtual keys in the snapshot every
`/v1/*` request gets `401`. This keeps revoking the last key a lock-down rather
than an accidental opening of the whole data plane.

A gateway running from a static bootstrap config with no keys stays keyless, so
local `fake-llm` development needs no setup.

Override either default with `server.require_auth`:

| value | behaviour on an empty key set |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | always deny (`401`) |
| `false` | always allow the keyless path |
| unset (default) | managed → deny, static local config → allow |

## 2. Control plane (dashboard) — users + roles

Human users authenticate to the control plane. v1 ships **local accounts** (argon2id password hashes). RBAC roles:

- **admin** — full control within scope (manage providers, routes, keys, members, budgets)
- **member** — create/edit routes and keys within scope
- **viewer** — read-only (dashboards, logs)

Roles are granted via `memberships` at an **org / team / project** scope. Permission checks resolve the most specific membership for the target resource.

### The capability table is the only source of truth

`CAPABILITIES` in `crates/rolter-control/src/rbac_matrix.rs` records, for every resource, what each of `read` / `create` / `update` / `delete` takes — a minimum scoped role, superadmin-only, or that the resource has no such action at all. **Both** the published matrix and the guard read it, so they cannot drift.

A guarded handler names a `(resource, action)` pair instead of a role:

```rust
authorize(&state, &principal, ScopeChain::org(org_id), cap!("provider", Create)).await?;
// deployment-wide, no scope to hold a role in:
authorize_superadmin(&principal, superadmin_cap!("feature_flags", Update))?;
```

`cap!` resolves the requirement through a `const fn`, so naming a resource the table does not define — or an action it marks as unsupported — is a **compile error**, and `superadmin_cap!` additionally fails to compile unless the table says the pair is superadmin-only. No handler names a `Role`; unit tests in `rbac_matrix.rs` scan every control-plane module to keep it that way, check the module list against `src/` so a new file cannot slip past, and assert that every row in the table is claimed by at least one guard.

Two read-only endpoints publish that table, so a dashboard never assembles a permission matrix of its own:

- `GET /api/v1/rbac/matrix` — every role and, per resource, the minimum role each action takes (or that the action is superadmin-only, or unsupported entirely). Any authenticated caller may read it; it describes rules, not anyone's access.
- `GET /api/v1/rbac/effective?org_id=&team_id=&project_id=` — the calling principal's resolved role at that scope chain and the concrete `resource:action` pairs they may perform, evaluated from their memberships.

`effective` is advisory to the client and authoritative only on the server: a caller that ignores it and issues the request anyway gets the same `403`. Scope precedence is unchanged — a project-scoped grant authorizes that project, not the whole org.

Read access is a viewer's and mutations are an admin's, with three deliberate exceptions:

- **deployment-wide policy** (feature flags, runtime/compatibility/adaptive policy, logging settings, cluster nodes, security settings, alerting, MCP tool-call logs) has no tenancy scope to be a member of, so it is superadmin-only;
- **global account lifecycle** — creating an org, editing or deleting a user account, and the model/pricing catalog — reaches across orgs, so it is superadmin-only too, while inviting a user *into* an org stays an org admin's;
- **a user's own things** — minting a virtual key for yourself takes `member` (a viewer cannot), and revoking your own MCP OAuth grant or session takes only a viewer membership plus ownership, which the handler checks after the guard.

Listing the pricing catalog (`GET /api/v1/model-prices`) and the effective model list (`GET /api/v1/models`) are not guarded at all today: any authenticated principal may read them. The table records `viewer` as the nominal floor for those reads; tightening them is tracked in #766.

## Roadmap

- **OAuth2 / OIDC SSO** — pluggable `IdentityProvider`; map IdP groups → roles.
- **LDAP** — bind + group mapping for enterprise directories.
- **JWT** service auth and short-lived tokens.
- **Audit log** surfaced in the UI.
- Optional **constant-time map** / pepper for virtual-key lookup hardening.
