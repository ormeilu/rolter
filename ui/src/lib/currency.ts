 * The deployment's settlement currency code.
 *
 * Spend and budgets are denominated in `currency.base` (see `CurrencyConfig` in
 * rolter-core) — the `_usd` suffixes on `cost_usd` and `limit_usd` are historic
 * names, not a guarantee of dollars. Screens used to print a literal `$` in
 * front of those numbers, which mislabels every non-USD deployment (#1182).
 *
 * The query key is shared with the model sheet's currency chooser, so the
 * settings are fetched once per session, and a failure falls back to USD rather
 * than rendering an amount with no unit at all.
